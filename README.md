# HeartDiseaseAnalysis
The project aims to analyse the heart disease data sets to predict the occurrence of heart disease using different classification models using R software. It identify the most important variables in the predictive model and perform data smoothing to predict trends by removing noise from a data set, allowing important patterns to stand out.
